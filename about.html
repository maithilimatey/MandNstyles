                    <p class = "about-desc">Hello, I'm Manisha Matey, and I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a former social work graduate who has found her calling in the world of fashion. My passion for fashion has been a lifelong affair, stemming from my early years where I found solace and joy in experimenting with fabrics, patterns, and styles. What began as a personal pursuit of creativity soon evolved into a profound mission to empower individuals through the transformative power of clothing. Through this venture, I aim to offer a plethora of services that not only cater to the fashion needs of individuals but also resonate with their sense of empowerment and self-expression. At M&NStyles, we pride ourselves on offering a diverse array of services, ranging from meticulously curated clothing lines to elegant gown rentals, personalized styling sessions, and exquisite bespoke customizations. Every aspect of our offerings is meticulously crafted to reflect the unique tastes and preferences of our clientele. Welcome to M&NStyles, where every garment tells a story of empowerment, and every client is celebrated for their unique sense of style.</p>

                    <p class = "about-desc2">I'm Nilima Gawande, a holder of an M.Sc in Maths with certifications from the Do Your Venture and Women's Startup Program at IIM, Bangalore. Having spent a decade as an Assistant Manager at LIC Housing Finance, I pivoted my career to become an entrepreneur. In 2011, I ventured into the education sector by taking on a franchise of Brainworks preschool. Over the past 13 years, I've successfully managed preschools, daycares, and various educational classes including zumba, dance, and tuition. Now, in collaboration with my partner Manisha Matey, I'm expanding my horizons with M&NStyles, aiming to offer affordable clothing to the masses. I'm dedicated to empowering individuals by providing employment opportunities to students, talented housewives, and single mothers, fostering confidence and satisfaction within my community.
